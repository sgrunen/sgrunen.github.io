<h1>“Why worry about AI if the urgent problem is climate change and the future of the planet is at stake?”</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is becoming an important part of how research is conducted, especially in the field of marine biology. Some of the current methods are outdated or just unsatisfactory when it comes to retrieving and analyzing information. As of right now, there are few projects that use AI, but as the technology continues to improve the use of AI will only grow. It has proven to be an effective method in many different fields. </p>
