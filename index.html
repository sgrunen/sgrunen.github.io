<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is becoming an important part of how research is conducted. Especially in the field of marine biology, some of the methods are outdated or just unsatisfactory when it comes to retrieving information. As of right now, there are few projects that use AI, but as developments continue to improve the use of AI will only grow as it has proven to be an effective method in many different fields. </p>
