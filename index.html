<h1>Ethics Surrounding Artificial Intelligence in Marine Biology</h1>

<h2>How can there be ethical issues in collecting data on sea creatures and ocean temperatures?</h2>

<p>Using AI for marine biology is one of the more notable uses of the technology. With this being said however, there are still a number of ethical concerns that arise when developing the AI and deciding what to do with the information the AI collects. Rising temperatures is a global issue, but there is a fine line between dictating which policies other countries implement in regards to the issue and trying create a global initiative to create a sustainable environment. Not only this, but there are concerns with large corporations creating unnecessary barriers when it comes to creating policy with the information researchers have gathered using AI. </p>

<ol>
	<li>Team Dynamics - The makeup of the team can lead to unconcious bias and skew the data results.</li>
	<li>Inclusion of Affected Peoples - Did the researchers keep in mind how their study could impact indigenous people and their rights with what to do with the information?</li>
	<li>Use of Autonomous Vehicles - What happens if an autonomous drone, sub, or boat crashes into something in international waters?</li>
	<li>Funding - Most marine biology research is conducted with grant money. The terms of the grant and who is supplying the money may influence the research itself and how the data is interpreted.</li>
	<li>Human Centric - are we keeping other living beings in mind when we do this research and make recommendations from it or are we just looking out for humans?
