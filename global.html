<h1>Polution and Global Warming</h1>
<h2>“Why worry about AI if the urgent problem is climate change and the future of the planet is at stake?”</h2>
<p>Despite many of the advantages that AI can contribute to fighting the environmental crisis, there are many ethical issues that come with continuing its development. For instance, the materials required to make AI can be harmful to the environment. Along with the materials, the process can be dangerous and produces high amounts of CO2 emissions as well. </p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>Pollution of our oceans is of great concern because it has negatively impacted the food industry, human health, and tourism. The problem has grown exponentially within the last couple decades and it is only getting worse (AI for Good, 2021). There are collections of floating debris the size of Mongolia on the ocean’s surface. However, only about 1% of the pollution in the ocean actually floats on the surface. This pollution can entangle or poison marine plants and animals. It can harm the very ecosystem that provides approximately half of the world’s breathable oxygen.</p>
