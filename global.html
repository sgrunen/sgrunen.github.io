<h1>Polution and Global Warming</h1>
<h2>“Why worry about AI if the urgent problem is climate change and the future of the planet is at stake?”</h2>
<p>Despite many of the advantages that AI can contribute to fighting the environmental crisis, there are many ethical issues that come with continuing its development. For instance, the materials required to make AI can be harmful to the environment. Along with the materials, the process can be dangerous and produces high amounts of CO2 emissions as well. </p>
